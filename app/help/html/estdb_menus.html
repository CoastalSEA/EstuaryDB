The steps for defining the boundary, centre-lines and section lines have sub-menus to enable:</p><div><ul><li><b>Generate</b> - use the built in tools to aid the creation of the lines. This option can be used to modify existing linework, or create new linework. The Sections &gt; Boundary tool also has an option to copy the Waterbody linework as an input.</li><li><b>Load</b> - load a shapefile with the lines to be used.</li><li><b>Edit</b> - interactively digitise or edit the linework.</li><li><b>Delete</b> - delete the saved lines for the selected Case.</li><li><b>Export</b> - export the saved lines for the selected Case to an ASCII text file (.txt), a Matlab data file (.mat), or a shape file (.shp). Text files include a header with details of the source and line type. The same information is included in the saved metadata struct for the other file formats.</li></ul></div><p>The Point and Line tools have a menu that is accessed by right clicking the mouse in the figure but outside the plot axes. This provides access to a set of context sensitive menus. They all include the Figure option, which provides access to the following options:</p><div><ul><li>Figure &gt; Redraw: update the line work of points and lines in the plot;</li><li>Figure &gt; Undo: revert to the previously save linework. If Save has not been used in the ssession, this will revert to any imported line work;</li><li>Figure &gt; Distance: display the distance between two points;</li><li>Figure &gt; Save: save the current points and lines;</li><li>Figure &gt; Save &amp; Exit: save the current data and exit;</li><li>Figure &gt; Quit: exit without saving. If new points and lines have been created the user is prompted to confirm that these do no need to be saved.</li></ul></div><p>When using the <b>Edit</b> option there are menus options for points and lines as follows:</p><div><ul><li>Point &gt; Add: add one or more points;</li><li>Point &gt; Edit: edit the position of any existing points;</li><li>Point &gt; Delete: delete existing points;</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Line &gt; Add: add one or more lines (each line is terminated with a NaN point);</li><li>Line &gt; Edit: edit the points in a line;</li><li>Line &gt; Extend: add points to the end of a line;</li><li>Line &gt; Insert: insert points within a line;</li><li>Line &gt; Join: join two lines together;</li><li>Line &gt; Split: divide a line into two;</li><li>Line &gt; Delete &gt; Points: delete one or more points in a line.</li><li>Line &gt; Delete &gt; Lines: delete one or more lines.</li></ul></div><p>For details of the conventions used for points and lines see the <a href="matlab:doc('points_lines_classes_functions')">Point &amp; Line</a> documentation.</p><p>Bespoke tools are provided to create the different line types as follows:</p><div><ul><li><b>Boundary</b> - Load or create a polygon, or set of lines, that define the estuary shoreline. This is used to determine the extent of the section lines. Consequently it does not have to be an exact, or detailed, representation of the actual shoreline but should be positioned at an elevation that captures the desired range for the hypsometry. For example to examine future change this might be close to the contour for Highest Tide + 1m to account for surge or sea level rise. Bespoke menus for the Boundary tool include the Line and Figure menus detailed above and:</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Boundary &gt; Resample: define the sampling interval along the line and resample the linework at the required intervals;</li><li>Boundary &gt; Smooth: use either a moving average of sgolay method to smooth the lines;</li><li>Boundary &gt; Reset: clear the existing lines and generate a new contour using NaN or an elevation.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><b>Channel Network</b> - Individual reaches are captured by defining the end points and using a function to trace the deepest channel between the two points. When selected the user is prompted to define the maximum accessible water level, the depth exponent (value between 5 and 10 usually works well, whereas smaller values tend to follow the shore in meandering channels), and the sampling interval for the linework that is generated. The menu options provided include Line and Figure as detailed above and the Centreline menu:</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Centreline &gt; Set: define start and end points and generate a centre-line that attempts to find the shortest distance between the end points constrained to also find the deepest part of the channel.</li><li>Centreline &gt; Resample: define the sampling interval along the line and resample the linework at the required intervals;</li><li>Centreline &gt; Smooth: use either a moving average of sgolay method to smooth the lines;</li><li>Centreline &gt; Reset: clear the existing lines..</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><b>Section Lines</b> - The Boundary and Centre-line need to be defined before calling this option.</li></ul></div><p>In addition to the Figure menu there is a Sections menu, with the following options:</p><div><ul><li>Sections &gt; Set: uses the points on the centre-line to define a set of cross-sections. The user is prompted to input the length of the line either side of the centre-line and the sections are then generated;</li><li>Sections &gt; Clip: clip the cross-section lines to the defined boundary;</li><li>Sections &gt; Add: add one or more points to the centre-line (either by inserting points, or as an extension of a line). This adds sections at the new centre-line points;</li><li>Sections &gt; Edit: adjust the end points of existing sections;</li><li>Sections &gt; Delete: remove one or more sections;</li><li>Sections &gt; Reset: revert to the initial centre-line defined sections;</li><li>Sections &gt; Label: add numbered labels to the sections.</li></ul></div><p>NOTE: <i>Clip</i> shortens the lines based on the intersection with the boundary. If the section does not cross the boundary within the specified section length, the section is excluded. Re-running <i>Clip</i> after some editing of the sections can result in more lines being omitted (because the the lines do not cross). It is therefore better to do the edits, and then <i>Set</i> the lines before applying the <i>Clip</i> tool.</p><p>Using the 3 sets of lines, the cross-sections can be extracted and the channel connectivity can be defined:</p><div><ul><li><b>Sections</b> - extract the depths along a set of cross-sections. Section lines need to have been defined before using this option.</li><li><b>Channel Links</b> - define the connections between the different reaches of the channel network. The Centreline needs to be defined before using this option.</li></ul></div><p>There are then options to view the various types of line work:</p><div><ul><li><b>View Sections &gt; Layout</b> - creates a plot of the boundary, centre-line and section lines;</li><li><b>View Sections &gt; Sections</b> - creates a composite plot of all the sections (the individual sections can be queried by clicking the mouse on a section line).</li><li><b>View Sections &gt; Network</b> - creates a graph plot of the network with the nodes labelled with the index of the point in the centre-line line set and the distance from the first point in parenthesis, with the line number defined on the edges between the nodes.</li></ul></div><h2 id="36">Setup &gt; Waterbody</h2><p>Similar to the boundary tool used for creating Sections, the Waterbody tools allows a bounding polygon to be defined for use when computing the surface area hypsometry (Setup &gt; Add Hypsometry from Grid &gt; Surface area).</p><div><ul><li><b>Generate</b> - use the built in tools to aid the creation of the lines. This option can be used to modify existing linework, create new linework, or copy the Sections &gt; Boundary tool linework.</li><li><b>Load</b> - load a shapefile with the lines to be used.</li><li><b>Edit</b> - interactively digitise or edit the waterbody linework.</li><li><b>Delete</b> - deletes the saved lines for the selected Case.</li><li><b>Export</b> - export the saved lines for the selected Case to an ASCII text file (.txt), a Matlab data file (.mat), or a shape file (.shp). Text files include a header with details of the source and line type. The same information is included in the saved metadata struct for the other file formats.</li><li><b>View</b> - creates a plot of the boundary.</li></ul></div><h2 id="38">Setup &gt; Input Parameters</h2><p>enter and edit the specified model parameters. The input parameters can be viewed on the Inputs tab.</p><h2 id="39">Setup &gt; Model Constants</h2><p>various constants are defined for use in models, such as the acceleration due to gravity, viscosity and density of sea water, and density of sediment. Generally, the default values are appropriate (9.81, 1.36e-6, 1025 , 2650 respectively) but these can be adjusted and saved with the project if required.</p><h2 id="40">Tools</h2><div><ul><li><b>Hypsometry</b>: use a loaded bathymetry data set to construct surface area, or along-channel width hypsometry datasets.

%% Setup > Sections
% A set of tools to create sections along one or more estuary reaches,
% define the connectivity, extract the sections for use in computing the
% width hypsometry (Setup > Add Hypsometry from Grid > Width). The steps
% for defining the boundary, centre-lines and section lines have sub-menus
% to enable:
%%
% * *Generate* - use the built in tools to aid the creation of the lines.
% This option can be used to modify existing linework, or create new
% linework. The Sections > Boundary tool also has an option to copy the Waterbody linework as an input. 
% * *Load* - load a shapefile with the lines to be used.
% * *Edit* - interactively digitise or edit the linework.
% * *Delete* - delete the saved lines for the selected Case.
% * *Export* - export the saved lines for the selected Case to an ASCII 
% text file (.txt), a Matlab data file (.mat), or a shape file (.shp). 
% Text files include a header with details of the source and line type. 
% The same information is included in the saved metadata struct for the other file formats.

%%
% The Point and Line tools have a menu that is accessed by right clicking
% the mouse in the figure but outside the plot axes. This provides access to
% a set of context sensitive menus. They all include the Figure option,
% which provides access to the following options:
%%
% * Figure > Redraw: update the line work of points and lines in the plot;
% * Figure > Undo: revert to the previously save linework. If Save has not
% been used in the ssession, this will revert to any imported line work;
% * Figure > Distance: display the distance between two points;
% * Figure > Save: save the current points and lines;
% * Figure > Save & Exit: save the current data and exit;
% * Figure > Quit: exit without saving. If new points and lines have been
% created the user is prompted to confirm that these do no need to be
% saved.

%%
% When using the *Edit* option there are menus options for points and lines
% as follows:
%%
% * Point > Add: add one or more points;
% * Point > Edit: edit the position of any existing points;
% * Point > Delete: delete existing points;
%%
% * Line > Add: add one or more lines (each line is terminated with a NaN
% point);
% * Line > Edit: edit the points in a line; 
% * Line > Extend: add points to the end of a line;
% * Line > Insert: insert points within a line;
% * Line > Join: join two lines together;
% * Line > Split: divide a line into two;
% * Line > Delete > Points: delete one or more points in a line.
% * Line > Delete > Lines: delete one or more lines.
%%
% For details of the conventions used for points and lines see the
% <matlab:doc('points_lines_classes_functions') Point & Line>
% documentation.

%%
% Bespoke tools are provided to create the different line types as follows:
%%
% * *Boundary* - Load or create a polygon, or set of lines, that define the
% estuary shoreline. This is used to determine the extent of the section lines.
% Consequently it does not have to be an exact, or detailed, representation of the actual
% shoreline but should be positioned at an elevation that captures the 
% desired range for the hypsometry. For example to examine future change
% this might be close to the contour for Highest Tide + 1m to account for
% surge or sea level rise. Bespoke menus for the Boundary tool include the 
% Line and Figure menus detailed above and:
%%
% * Boundary > Resample: define the sampling interval along the line and
% resample the linework at the required intervals;
% * Boundary > Smooth: use either a moving average of sgolay method to
% smooth the lines;
% * Boundary > Reset: clear the existing lines and generate a new contour
% using NaN or an elevation.

%%
% * *Channel Network* - Individual reaches are captured by defining the end
% points and using a function to trace the deepest channel between the two
% points. When selected the user is prompted to define the maximum
% accessible water level, the depth exponent (value between 5 and 10 usually 
% works well, whereas smaller values tend to follow the shore in meandering channels), 
% and the sampling interval for the linework that is generated.  
% The menu options provided include Line and Figure as detailed
% above and the Centreline menu:
%%
% * Centreline > Set: define start and end points and generate a
% centre-line that attempts to find the shortest distance between the end
% points constrained to also find the deepest part of the channel.
% * Centreline > Resample: define the sampling interval along the line and
% resample the linework at the required intervals;
% * Centreline > Smooth: use either a moving average of sgolay method to
% smooth the lines;
% * Centreline > Reset: clear the existing lines..

%%
% * *Section Lines* - The Boundary and Centre-line need to be defined
% before calling this option.

%%
% In addition to the Figure menu there is a Sections menu, with the
% following options:
%%
% * Sections > Set: uses the points on the centre-line to define a set of
% cross-sections. The user is prompted to input the length of the line either
% side of the centre-line and the sections are then generated;
% * Sections > Clip: clip the cross-section lines to the defined boundary;
% * Sections > Add: add one or more points to the centre-line (either by 
% inserting points, or as an extension of a line). This adds sections at 
% the new centre-line points;
% * Sections > Edit: adjust the end points of existing sections;
% * Sections > Delete: remove one or more sections;
% * Sections > Reset: revert to the initial centre-line defined sections;
% * Sections > Label: add numbered labels to the sections.
%%
% NOTE: _Clip_ shortens the lines based on the intersection with the
% boundary. If the section does not cross the boundary within the specified
% section length, the section is excluded. Re-running _Clip_ after some
% editing of the sections can result in more lines being omitted (because
% the the lines do not cross). It is therefore better to do the edits, and
% then _Set_ the lines before applying the _Clip_ tool.

%%
% Using the 3 sets of lines, the cross-sections can be extracted and the
% channel connectivity can be defined:
%%
% * *Sections* - extract the depths along a set of cross-sections. Section
% lines need to have been defined before using this option.
% * *Channel Links* - define the connections between the different reaches 
% of the channel network. The Centreline needs to be defined before using
% this option.

%%
% There are then options to view the various types of line work:
%%
% * *View Sections > Layout* - creates a plot of the boundary, centre-line 
% and section lines;
% * *View Sections > Sections* - creates a composite plot of all the
% sections (the individual sections can be queried by clicking the mouse on a
% section line).
% * *View Sections > Network* - creates a graph plot of the network with
% the nodes labelled with the index of the point in the centre-line line set and
% the distance from the first point in parenthesis, with the line number
% defined on the edges between the nodes.

%% Setup > Waterbody
% Similar to the boundary tool used for creating Sections, the Waterbody
% tools allows a bounding polygon to be defined for use when computing the
% surface area hypsometry (Setup > Add Hypsometry from Grid > Surface
% area).
%%
% * *Generate* - use the built in tools to aid the creation of the lines.
% This option can be used to modify existing linework, create new linework,
% or copy the Sections > Boundary tool linework.
% * *Load* - load a shapefile with the lines to be used.
% * *Edit* - interactively digitise or edit the waterbody linework.
% * *Delete* - deletes the saved lines for the selected Case.
% * *Export* - export the saved lines for the selected Case to an ASCII 
% text file (.txt), a Matlab data file (.mat), or a shape file (.shp). 
% Text files include a header with details of the source and line type. 
% The same information is included in the saved metadata struct for the other file formats.
% * *View* - creates a plot of the boundary.

%% Setup > Input Parameters
% enter and edit the specified model parameters. The input parameters can be viewed on the Inputs tab.
%% Setup > Model Constants
% various constants are defined for use in models, such as the acceleration due to gravity, viscosity and density of sea water, and density of sediment. Generally, the default values are appropriate (9.81, 1.36e-6, 1025 , 2650 respectively) but these can be adjusted and saved with the project if required.

%% Tools
% * *Hypsometry*: use a loaded bathymetry data set to construct surface area, or along-channel width hypsometry datasets. These options replicate the data formats that can be imported using the Import Spatial Data options.
% * *Hypsometry > Surface area*: derive the surface area hypsometry from an imported bathymetry.
% * *Hypsometry > Width*: derive the along-channel width hypsometry from an imported bathymetry.
% * *Gross Properties*: the large-scale, or gross, morphological properties can be added
% as a table once, Tidal Levels and a Surface area or Width hypsometry have
% been defined. Add a row of data to the morphological properties
% table by selecting a hypsometry and a tidal data set to use.
% * *Derive Output*: initialises the Derive Output UI to select and define manipulations of the data or call external functions and load the result as new data set.
% * *User Tools*: calls function ‘edb_user_tools.m’, which includes a function to:
%
% # create a figure tabulating a dataset (tabular data only);
% # add additional properties to a table and  (tabular estuary properties data only);
% # run and save the results of a convergence analysis (e.g. for along channel properties);
% # the option for the user to add functions as required.


%% Analysis
% * *Plots*: initialises the Plot UI to select variables and produce
% various types of plot. The user selects the Case, Dataset and Variable to
% used, along with the Plot type and any Scaling to be applied from a series of drop down lists.
% * *Statistics*: initialiss the Statistics UI to select data and run a range of standard statistical methods.
% * *Tabular Plots*: Bespoke plots for scalar tabular data.
%
% # plot a scatter diagram of two or three variables from any case (selected variables must be the same length);
% # plot a bar chart of a variable with the bars coloured based on a selected classification variable (from the same dataset as the main variable);
% # plot a range plot by selecting low-mean-high values of two properties (eg tidal ranges and river discharge);
% # plot a Geyer-McCready plot (Figure 6 in 2014 paper) using the gross properties of the estuaries
%
% * *Hypsometry Plots*: Bespoke plots for the surface area and width
% hypsometry data sets.
%
% # convergence plot has panels for along-channel variation of width, csa and depth and a fourth panel for an image of where the sections were taken (if available in the dataset).
%
% * *User Plots*: calls the edb_user_plots function, allowing additional
% plots to be added as required.
